# Autonomous Race Car

This project develops an autonomous race car with precise lane detection and obstacle avoidance using real-time camera feeds and ultrasonic sensors. It tackles low-light, curved, and multi-lane conditions, with added safety features like vehicle tracking, accident alerts via GPS and Google Maps, and emergency brakes for rapid response.
